# JARVIS
As we know Python is an emerging language so it becomes easy to write a script for Voice Assistant in Python. The instructions for the assistant can be handled as per the requirement of user. Speech recognition is the process of converting speech into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. In Python there is an API called Speech Recognition which allows us to convert speech into text. It was an interesting task to make my own assistant. It became easier to send emails without typing any word, searching on Google without opening the browser, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music, tweeting with the help of a single voice command. In the current scenario, advancement in technologies are such that they can perform any task with same effectiveness or can say more effectively than us. By making this project, I realized that the concept of AI in every field is decreasing human effort and saving time. 
This project includes more than 40 functionalities, some of the major mentioned below:
1.	It can send emails.
2.	It can tweet.
3.	It can play rock, paper, scissors.
4.	It can send text on WhatsApp.
5.	It can open command prompt, notepad, adobe reader, etc.
6.	It can play music, and will stop on one command.
7.	It can play my favorite song.
8.	It can give weather forecast.
9.	It can set alarm.
10.	It can perform some basic calculations.
11.	It can check power left in the laptop.
12.	You can ask any procedure on activating how to do mode.

Now the basic question arises in mind that how it is an AI? The virtual assistant that I have created is like if it is not an A.I, but it is the output of a bundle of the statement. But fundamentally, the mail purpose of A.I machines is that it can perform human tasks with the same efficiency or even more efficiently than humans. It is a fact that my virtual assistant is not a very good example of A.I., but it is an A.I.
